Definitions:

elements = 			Element is the most general base class from which all element objects (i.e. objects that represent elements) in a Document inherit. 
					It only has methods and properties common to all kinds of elements. More specific classes inherit from Element .

createElement = 	createElement() is used to dynamically create an HTML element node with the specified name via JavaScript. 
					This method takes the name of the element as the parameter and creates that element node.
					In JavaScript, we can access elements by using the getElementsByName() method. 
					It helps the user to get an element with the help of a name. 
					The name here is the attribute name of the HTML element.

Atribute = 			a collection of objects that belong to a built-in Attr class, with name and value properties

setAttribute =   	setAttribute in JavaScript is mostly used to assign a value to the HTML attributes. 
	        		We can also add a new attribute with a value to a certain HTML element using the setAttribute() function. 
	                The setAttribute() function returns undefined / NONE.
              		The name specifies the attribute name whose value is set. 
               		It's automatically converted to lowercase if you call the setAttribute() on an HTML element. 
               		The value specifies the value to assign to the attribute.

toggleAttribute = 	The toggleAttribute() method of the Element interface toggles a Boolean attribute (removing it if it is present and adding it if it is not present) on the given element.

appendchild =  		The JavaScript appendChild() is a method of the Node interface, used to append nodes (typically elements) at the end of a specified parent node. 
	       			It can be executed on existing child nodes or by creating new elements: Creating elements.

removeAttribute = 	The removeAttribute() method removes an attribute, and does not have a return value. 
	          		removeAttributeNode() method removes an Attr object, and returns the removed object.

createDocumentFragment = 	DocumentFragment s are DOM Node objects which are never part of the main DOM tree. 
			 				The usual use case is to create the document fragment, append elements to the document fragment and then append the document fragment to the DOM tree. 
			 				In the DOM tree, the document fragment is replaced by all its children

DOM =   	 		The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. 
	 				It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. 
	 				The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

preventDefault = 	The preventDefault() method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action that belongs to the event will not occur. 
                 	or example, this can be useful when: Clicking on a "Submit" button, prevent it from submitting a form. 
                 	Clicking on a link, prevent the link from following the URL.

querySelector =		The querySelector() is a method used for searching and returning the very first element within the document that matches the given selector. 
					The queryselector in javascript only returns the element that matches with one of the specified CSS selectors, or a group of selectors.

eventlisteners =	An event listener in JavaScript is a way that you can wait for user interaction like a click or keypress and then run some code whenever that action happens. 
					One common use case for event listeners is listening for click events on a button. const button = document.
